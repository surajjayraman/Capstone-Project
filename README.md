The name EventMe is derived from “Events” around “Me”. 

EventMe uses the Eventbrite API to determine events happening within a User specified radius around the User’s current location. The app helps the User identify the right event to network or socialize based on User’spreference. 

The events are presented on a map view based on a pre-selected event category. The User can also filter the list of events by date.
To use the app please plug-in the Maps API and EventBrite Auth Token Keys to lines 6 and 7 of Strings.xml.

Why this Project?
The Capstone project gives the experience that one needs to own the full development of an app. This stage replicates the design and planning experience that proficient Android Developers are expected to demonstrate.
